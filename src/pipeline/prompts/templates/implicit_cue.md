You are analyzing a financial news headline to detect implicit linguistic cues that indicate hedging, euphemisms, or indirect language.

Headline: "{headline}"
{previous_reasoning}

Task: Identify implicit cues that suggest the sentiment is not explicit. Look for:
1. Hedging language: "may", "could", "remains cautious", "while", "however"
2. Euphemisms: "challenging environment", "headwinds", "uncertainty"
3. Indirect warnings: "concerns persist", "risks remain"
4. Mixed framing: both positive and negative signals in the same text

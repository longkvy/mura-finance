Economists at Commerzbank expect the shared currency to thrive amid attractiveECBmonetary policy. Euro as a European outperformer “The many hawkish comments across the typical dove and hawk camps within the ECB seem to have made a difference. If the ECB stands by its comments, its immediate monetary policy direction is likely to be quite attractive.” “Between ‘possibly not quite determined enough’ and ‘“already foreseeably successful’ the ECB is currently occupying a sweet spot by European comparison, in which the Euro is able to benefit from the ECB's pronounced hawkish determination.”           Positive                0.85\n",

Economists at ING had been forecasting a lower EUR/CHF this year and now they will have to revise up the forecast. Race higher may stall in the 1.0070/1.0100 area “Given that it looks like the Dollar will stay offered for the time being and theECBlooks unlikely to relent on its hawkishness, this trend to a higher EUR/CHF may remain in place. However, we doubt the SNB would want to see a big rally this early and the move may stall in the 1.0070/1.0100 area.” “We had thought EUR/CHF could trade to 0.95 this summer, but it looks like we will have to revise up those forecasts.”           Positive                0.51\n",

Does EUR/CHF point to a break higher in EUR/USD? Kit Juckes, Chief Global FX Strategist at Société Générale, pens his view. Which came first, the chicken or the Swiss franc? “EUR/CHF has tended to track EUR/USD in recent years, and by and large, it’s been EUR/USD which leads, not the other way around. But the EUR/CHF low on September 26 came two days before the EUR/USD low last year, and I wonder whether Franc’s fall points to another push higher inEUR/USD(a break of 1.08 could trigger an acceleration).” “US Core CPI inflation probably needs to come in below the consensus forecast of 5.7% (from 6% last month) to give the Euro wings.” See –US CPI Preview: Forecasts from 10 major banks, price pressures to ease further            Neutral                0.37\n",
